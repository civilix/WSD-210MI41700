"While it lacks a decent amount of call of duty like most other games, Call of Duty: Global Offensive delivers fast, addictive, and action packed call of duty with every match.  However, the call of duty may be call of duty for some players, which unfortunatley may be call of duty for some call of duty.  Overall, call of duty is call of duty.  Call of duty call of duty call of duty call of duty call of duty call of duty call of duty. 10/10",False,1,0.99676,65317
"Global Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.",False,1,0.99676,74539

"I've been playing this game on-and-off for about 11 years and I still love it. No it doesn't have amazing graphics and you need a subscription to unlock a majority of the content. But what you have is an very difficult game with a steep learning curve. If you're new it will take you a couple of hours to start figuring everything out. And once yu do, everything is extremely rewarding. From the time it may take you to drive a tank to a battlezone, to taking off and flying to a contested airspace, to setting up an AT gun in a bush and lying in ambush, you'll grow an appreciation for this game. The more time you put in, the more rewarding it is. Plain and simple.  For a game that was released in 2001, this game and community has had incredible staying power. It's been a long road getting onto steam and seeing the server so full of players again has really brought a tear to my eye.",False,1,0.99676,326132
